The table below can be used to explore the CMAP-RSI data directly. Each row represents a specific experiment that was performed in CMAP: a drug (cmap_name), drug concentration (concentration), applied to a cell (cell2). Note that there may be repeated rows for the same type of experiment (although each row is unique).
