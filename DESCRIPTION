Description: The Connectivity Map is a dataset of cell line perturbations by drugs. Both
  the vehicle control (as untreated approximation) and perturbation are profiled using gene
  expression microarrays. This project uses RSI as a measure of radiosensitivity and evaluates
  the differences in RSI between vehicle control and perturbations under the assumption these
  differences could enrich for radiosensitizers or radioprotectors.
